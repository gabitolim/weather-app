# Weather App using React!

I've been learning through a course, basic front-end projects. This is one of them! 

I used javaScript in React, and ran it on Vite.
Integration of an API to fetch weather data using Postman.
Basic CSS with no external libraries.

# Lacking...

No error handling in case no input is written before hitting 'Search'.
Still no testing.
